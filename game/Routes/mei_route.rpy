    "Outside of Pigsy’s noodle shop, Mei is still playing Monkey Mech. Sweat drips down her forehead as she focuses on beating the final boss. It doesn’t take long for her to beat the game. She cheers, jumping up and down."
    mei "“Yes! Beat the high score yet again! Woo!”"
    "Mei checks her phone to look at the time. Her eyes widen, realizing she is late to the cooking competition."
    mei "“Oh shoot! I’m late!” Mei runs off towards the stadium."
    mei "“I hope they saved me a seat.”"
    "Meanwhile, down the street, Fyuree is running away from a crazy love-struck mob."
    fp "“Ahhhh!!!”"
    "“Fyureeeee! I love you! Please sign my shirt!”"
    fp "“Come on, guys! This isn’t funny anymore!” Fyuree continues to run as fast as they can from the mob."
    "Unfortunately, they are in such a panic that they don’t notice Mei until too late."
    "Mei and Fyuree run into each other and fall over. Fyuree sits on the ground, rubbing the back of their head."
    fp "“Owww,”"
    mei "Mei groans, but quickly stands. She reaches out her hand to Fyuree to help them up. “Hey, are you okay? Sorry about that?”"
    fp "Fyuree takes Mei’s hand and stands. “No, it’s ok. Sorry, I was just in such a rush.”"
    "“Fyureeeee!!! I love youuuuu!!! Marry Me!!!”"
    "Mei looks behind Fyuree and raises an eyebrow."
    mei "“Uhhh… is that an angry mob behind you?”"
    fp "“Mob yes. Angry… well… it’s kind of complicated. I just need to find a place to hide.”"
    "The mob is quickly catching up to the two."
    fp "“Huh… well, I don’t know what your deal is, but you look like you could use a friend right about now.” Mei takes Fyuree’s hand and runs off into the city, away from the mob. “Come on! I know a place where you can hide.”"

############## SCENE TWO #################

    "Mei takes you to a place that looks questionable, to say the least. One wall is completely covered in screens and monitors, other than that one wall the rest of the room looked like a secret base."
    fp "“What is this place?”"
    mei "“Oh, this? This is where I spy on my friends, I also hid cameras on some of my friends as well in case they go missing, all for safety reasons of course.”"
    fp "“Okay…”"
    mei "“You can hide in here while everyone outside cools down.”"
    fp "“Whew, thanks so much”"
    mei "“The name’s Mei, nice to meet you.”"
    fp "“Mine’s Fyuree Pashe.”"
    mei "“Anyways, make yourself at home for now.”"
    fp "“Thank you so much.”"
    "You look around the room taking in the surroundings, the room was lit up by neon green lights that emitted from the floors, walls, and ceilings. There was a ladder on one wall that led to a second floor with no walls, so you could see it from the bottom floor. A small nook in the corner of the room looked to be a regular hang-out space. A comfy couch against one wall and a TV against another wall with a long table divided between the two."
    "A wide range of video games is lined beside the TV."
    fp "“Do you have any Mortal Honor games?”"
    "Mei gasped at your question."
    mei "“You play Mortal Honor?! Which one is your favorite?!”"
    fp "“Mortal Honor X. The graphics are so good and some of the new characters they added are so badass.”"
    mei "“Oh my gosh, no way!”"
    fp "“I’ve been playing the games ever since I was little but I haven’t had much time to play it recently.”"
    mei "“You can play any of the games if you want, I have some old ones and most of the newer ones.”"
    fp "“Thanks, I would love to get back into it. But I want to look around a bit more if that’s alright.”"
    mei "“Yeah, sure. I can get the TV set up while you do that. Let me know if you have any questions.”"
    fp "“Will do.”"
    "You walk around some more and notice a hallway and to your left stood a large mech suit that resembled a monkey. Of all things you’d expect to find in here, a mech suit certainly wasn’t one of them."
    fp "“What the heck is a large mech suit doing here?”"
    mei "“Oh, that’s for MK in case the city is under attack and he needs his giant suit to fight. Me, Pigsy, Sandy, and Tang always show up to help him.”"
    fp "“Yeah, I think I saw you guys on the news once, Demon Bull King came back and you guys defeated him.”"
    mei "“Yup. That’s us!”"
    fp "“I’m surprised people haven’t made a lot of merch of you guys yet.”"
    mei "“They have it’s just very expensive or hard to find. Anyway, that suit has helped us on multiple occasions, so we keep it stored in a safe and private space. Sandy has talked about giving it a fresh new coat.”"
    fp "“Good call. Hey, you ready to play Mortal Honor?”"
    mei "“If by that you mean you’re ready to me to kick your ass? Then hell yes!”"
    "Before you guys can race to the couch, you both hear a beep sound from the monitors. Mei moves closer to the monitors while you stay in the spot watching her and the monitors, she clicks on the screen that has a red line outlining it. A clear view of a young man walking, he looks around searching for someone."
    mei "“It’s MK! He should be able to help us!”"
    fp "“Where is he?”"
    mei "“He’s near the anti-gravity arcade, it’s a bit far, but I’ll text him and let him know to stay there and that we’re on our way.”"
    "A sound came from her phone, letting you know she just sent a message."
    mei "“C’mon let’s go!”"

############ SCENE THREE #############


    "Mei pushes you outside of the safety of the headquarters to her friend."
    fp "“Mei—"
    mei "“There he is. Hey, MK! MK, Hey!”"
    "Both Mei and you stop when MK turns toward the two of you."
    fp "“He’s under the spell.” You look at Mei, who frowns, but comes back to a grin. She rests her fists on her hips."
    mei "“I can handle this.”"
    "A few seconds later proves that Mei can’t handle this, as MK, upon seeing Mei close to his beloved, becomes overwhelmed with rage and attacks Mei."
    mei "“MK, It’s me, Mei! Your friend?” She avoids MK’s attack another time, but she still continues to convince MK to snap out of it, but it doesn’t work as well as she hopes."
    "You look on with worry. You have to do something."

    menu:
        "Calm him down":
            "You thrust both your hands in between Mei and MK."
            fp "“Cut it out, MK, please.”"
            "MK turns to your voice and quits going after Mei. He blinks at you, reminding you of a puppy."
            pass

        "Yell at him":
            fp "“MK, you’re being crazy, you know that?! Calm down!”"
            "MK shrinks back, and nods. He pulls his arm like a cage towards him. He looks from the ground to you, studying your expression to avoid being yelled at again."

############ SCENE FIVE ############

    mk "“MI AMOR! MY LOVE!” MK watches as you are thrown over a Bull Clone’s shoulder as they begin to make a run for it."
    fp "“I AM NOT YOUR LOVE!” you manage to scream those words before being out of earshot from the hero duo."
    "MK’s eyes widen, his hands grasp his neck softly as he falls to his knees. He begins to let out harsh gasps as a light pink smoke begins to flow down from his lips. MK’s eyes water a bit as he looks up after his painful recovery, the only thing he could see was two blobs inside a giant truck. The sound of the engine revving filling his ears as the tires made a loud screech before driving away, leaving MK and Mei in the dust."
    "Or so he thought. As MK’s vision began to get clearer, he heard Mei let out a loud whistle. Soon, the sound of a motorcycle filled the air as Mei changed into her suit and put her helmet on, ready to chase after Red Son and his lackeys."
    mk "MK gave a quick shake of his head before speaking up. “Mei, what’s going on?”"
    mei "Mei gave MK a shocked look, but she didn't hesitate to respond. “I’m going after Red Son, he has a friend of mine.”"
    "MK didn’t have to hear anymore as he gave a nod. Mei smiled at the simple gesture as she began to speed down the road with MK right behind her, hitching a ride on his staff, both of them ready to do whatever it takes to get you back."

    "Red Son hopped out of the driver’s seat, his shoes hitting the floor with a harsh thud. He snaps his fingers as a Bull Clone, once again, throws you over their shoulder and carries you while following the redhead. Everything was calm and slow. That was until you caught sight of Red Son’s hair bursting into flames. He then begins to rush inside, Bull Clones right behind him as he tinkers with a small control panel located near the door."
    rs "“That should keep those dorks away,” You could hear him mutter under his breath. Red Son then looks your way and gives you a small smirk as he makes his way through the hallway. An alarm soon blares throughout the hallway, but this doesn’t seem to bother Red Boy. If anything, he threw his head back and laughed at the sound, knowing that everything was going as planned."
    mei "“Argh! W-What?!” Mei and MK watch as the invisible lasers that glowed through their legs flickered away and steel walls shot up from the ground, trapping them. A speaker soon crackled to life."
    rs "“It seems the peasants have fallen right into my trap,”"
    mei "“Where is Fyuree?!” Red Son cackles as his voice echoes throughout the enclosed steel room."
    rs "“As if I’d ever tell you. I will make you an offer though,”"
    "Mei turned to MK, who gave a hesitant nod of his head."
    rs "“IF, you can make it through this steel maze, I’ll hand them over, safe and sound, but if you fail. Well, I’ll let you see what happens then,” Another laugh could be heard before the speakers went quiet."
    mk "MK grins as he places a hand on Mei’s shoulder. “C’mon, we can do this!”"
    mei "Mei’s eyes go wide for a bit, but her previous worry fades as she gives MK a determined smile. “You’re right. Let’s do this!”"

    "You watch as Red Son sits down at a desk that is littered with scraps of metal, tools and blueprints. A small smirk tugs at the man’s lips as he turns his attention to you as he places a hand on his chest, a sense of superiority oozing from his tone of voice and stance."
    rs "“Interested in my inventions are you? I’m not surprised. I, Red Son, have engineered all the machines you see before you,” Red Son stands up from his seat before taking a hold of your hand, his grip firm, yet gentle."
    rs "He looks into your eyes for a minute or two before opening your hand and placing a small robot atop your palm. ”This is just a prototype, but think of all the magnificent things I could build for you! If only you’ll have me,”"
    "You watch the small robot walk around your palm for a few minutes, but you eventually pick the robot up and gently place it down on the desk. Red Son lets out an exasperated sigh as he stays silent for a moment. His eyes focused on the hands that he held in his own, your hands. He pondered for a bit longer before looking up from your hands and staring into your eyes. He started to lean in closer, pressing his forehead against your own."
    rs "“I like your face, ” he said, receiving a confused look from you at the vague compliment. Though this wasn’t the end of his words. “I want to gift you the world, conquer it and rule with you by my side but, I have to know. Do you love me?”"


menu:

    "Yes":

        fp "“I do love you, but I’m gonna have to pass on the whole ‘conquering the world thing,” Red Son raises a brow at your refusal to conquer the world but he doesn’t press any further. He thinks about your response for a moment before speaking."
        rs "“Well, if you don’t want to conquer the world,” he turned his body to the left, his right hand holding yours as his left hand gestures to the security monitors that showed various viewpoints of Megapolis, “Why not conquer the city?”"
        menu:
            "Yes":
                "You wonder what this guy's deal is with world domination."
                fp "“Yeah, no thanks,” Once again, Red Son is baffled by the fact that you have no interest in world domination."
                rs "“So let me get this straight. You don't want to conquer the world and you don’t want to conquer the city. Is there anything at all that you want to conquer?”"
                "You slip your hand away from his soft hold before moving your gaze from his hand up and meeting his eyes as you notice his face fall at your question. He’s left stunned for a bit, not sure how to respond. How can you be in love with someone and not want to rule the world and have them by your side?"
                fp "“I’m sorry. I don’t think this is gonna work between us, not if you have your heart set on ruling the world,” Soon after, you see Red Son stumble back, his hand latching onto his throat and his mouth agape as a light pink smoke begins to froth and leave his mouth."
                jump redson_reject

            "No":
                "You squint your eyes at him. Why was he so set on ruling the world? This isn’t what you wanted, if he can’t let that go, then you wanted no part in his plan. You soon yank your hand away from his soft grasp. This elicits a small flinch from him as he turns to look at you, his face framed with worry."
                rs "“Dear, is something the matter?”"
                fp "“Yes. I don’t want to be with you. Not if it means taking over the world and having people suffer for the sake of your twisted idea of love!”"
                "You watch his eyes widen at your words as he slaps his hand across his mouth, small wisps of light pink smoke seeping through the sides of his hand. His body was shaking and jerking with each mumbled cough. Every cough became harsher with each passing second."
                jump redson_reject


    "No":
        fp "“No, I don’t love you. Much less conquer the world with you.”"
        "You feel Red Son’s hands slack, your hands slipping out of his with ease as his own hands shoot up to grab his throat. Small puffs of light pink smoke escape his lips as he begins to hack and wheeze. He attempts to massage the sides of his throat to ease the pain of the violent coughs, but it isn’t enough."
        "Not a second later, he falls to his knees, a hand on his chest while he uses the other to stabilize himself. The relentless coughing continues until it begins to slow, the smoke beginning to clear as well."

    "Once his body begins to calm and only light coughs leave his body, you place a hand on his back, rubbing your hand against his back in slow circles. It wasn’t much, but his coughs soon began to decrease until one last cough escaped him along with a small puff of smoke."
    fp "“Are you okay now?”"
    "Red Son doesn’t respond. His body still and his expression unreadable. It isn’t until you feel something slap your hand away that you come back to your senses."
    rs "“Don’t touch me you, peasant!”"
    "Red Son screams at you. The sudden tone shift made you step back a bit, unsure of whether you should speak up or stay quiet. Either way, you were a bit relieved that he was fine after his violent coughing fit."

############ SCENE SIX ################
    "You marvel at the beautiful garden outside Mei’s house. MK doesn’t have much of a reaction, so you assume he’s been here before. On the other hand Red Son seemed shocked, and you noticed Mei kept looking back at you all nervously."
    "She obviously wasn’t comfortable with the arrangement. Then again, after seeing how much damage MK and Red Son had caused, you weren’t surprised. As you all approach the door, Mei holds out a hand."
    mei "“Hold up a second.”"
    "You pause as Mei walks up to the door. A red light scans her, and the door opens."
    an "{b}“Welcome home, Mei.”{/b}"
    fp "“Wow.”"
    mk "“I know! Fancy, right?”"
    "Red Son just rolled his eyes and huffed. Mei turns around and gives you all a stern look, but you notice it’s mostly directed at MK."
    mei "“Everyone, keep your hands in your pockets.”"
    "You notice MK immediately slam his hands into his pockets. You slide your hands into your pockets, and Mei glares at Red Son until he also complies, although with a lot of grumbling."
    "As you all walk into Mei’s house you’re amazed by the amount of fancy and historical artifacts. It was like being in a museum. No wonder Mei told you all to keep your hands in your pockets. Mei leads you all into a room with a table in the middle which you all sit at."
    "You look around the room and notice the walls are glass, and through them you can see a beautiful garden. In front of the glass are a bunch of wooden panels with green designs on them. Overall, the room looked very fancy, but at the same time felt like a room to relax in."
    mei "“You three wait here. I need to go grab my laptop.”"
    "Mei leaves the room, leaving you with MK and Red Son."
    mk "“Hey, Red Son, when you were with Fyuree, were you being super affectionate with her or something? Because that’s what happened to me.”"
    rs "“What?! Of course not! I’d never show any affection for a peasant!”"
    "You can see a tinge of red in Red Son’s cheeks, and his quick rejection shows just how embarrassed he was about it. But you knew the truth."

    menu:
        "Stay quiet":
            "You decide to stay quiet to save Red Son the embarrassment of the truth. MK is rubbing his chin though, and giving Red Son a suspicious stare."
            mk "“Are you sure? I mean, if you weren’t doing that, then what were you doing? Wait a second, are you blushing?”"
            rs "“I am not blushing!”"
            mk "“Are you sure? Because it kind of looks-”"
            "MK is cut off as Red Son tries to punch him, his eyes blazing."
            rs "“I said I wasn’t noodle boy!”"
            "Red Son continues to attack MK, and you sigh internally. Even when they’re not acting abnormal, it seems like these two were still pretty destructive."
            fp "“Will you two stop fighting?”"
            "You try to get the two to stop fighting before they break something. You’re so distracted with trying to calm them down that you don’t notice Mei coming back into the room. She frowns when she sees Red Son and MK fighting, but when she notices you trying to stop them she smiles."
            pass

        "Out him":
            "You decide to mess with Red Son by telling the truth. You give a little cough to get MK’s attention."

            mk "“I knew it!”"

            fp "“Really? I thought you said you wanted to conquer the world with me. And now you call me a peasant? How rude.”"

            rs "“How dare you mock me, Red Son!”"
            "Okay, so maybe messing around with a fire demon might not have been the smartest idea. You dodge a punch that Red Son throws your way, then get up and start running when the barrage continues. Okay, so maybe this was a really bad idea."
            mei "“What is going on here?”"
            "You turn to see Mei, who had re-entered the room and was now giving you a very annoyed glare. MK was laughing on the floor and being no help, but Mei stepped in before Red Son got a chance to actually hurt you."

#—----------------------------------------------------
    mei "“Alright, everyone at the table. Now!”"
    "You can practically feel energy coming off from Mei as she yelled ‘now’, and everyone sat down around the table. Mei set down a laptop on the table, flipping it open. She also sets two black button looking things down next to her laptop."
    mei "“So, if we want to figure out what’s going on out there, we need to actually, well, get out into the city. I’ll stay here to monitor, and MK and Red Boi, you can take these cameras so we can keep track of you while you go do some searching.”"

    rs "“There’s no way I’m getting involved in one of your noodle-brained schemes.”"

    rs "“What? How dare you! I, Red Son, am not afraid of anything! Also, I could be so much more stealthy than the noodle boy!”"
    mei "“Oh yeah? Prove it.”"
