    mk "Okay."

    fp "Yeah, I think that whatever’s happening to the city is happening to the Monkey King, too."
    "So, it seems that the Monkey King wouldn’t be any help to you two now. MK sees that and begins to ponder up a solution. Though his thinking is interrupted by the sound of rapid footsteps and overlapping yells. And there near the door, you could see a mob coming up the stairs and attempting to step in through the doorway at the same exact time. "
    fp "MK, we need a plan, fast!"
    "You yell, worried that the mob may barge in at any second. MK scans the room, trying to find an escape route, but his plans shift when his eyes land on the staff that laid on the counter, on the other side of the room. There were only a few problems with this plan he had come up with."
    "One, he would have to leave you alone for a while as he runs to the other side of the room to grab the staff, two, he could possibly get attacked by the love zombies, three, the love zombies would have a chance to get to you and take you away. All these consequences stirred inside his brain, he was starting to rethink his options, but he looked at you."
    "He saw the fear in your eyes as you watched the door with the utmost focus and that's when he made up his mind."
    mk "Do you trust me?"
    "MK holds out his hand as you stare at his hand for a moment before giving him a smile and placing your hand in his."
    fp "Yes,"
    "You see his smile grow as he gives your hand a gentle squeeze before leading you to a window sill where he opens the window. He gestures to you to head out through it, to which you do. He doesn’t let go of your hand as he makes sure that you make it safe on the fire escape balcony."
    mk "Stay here, wait for my signal and hold your hand out, okay?"
    "You nod as MK smiles."
    mk "Good,"
    "You feel the warmth of his hand fade as he slowly lets go to go back to the mob and Monkey King, who was giving MK a death glare."
    "MK takes a deep breath, you watch him, trying to stay hidden but also wanting to see what the young man would do."
    mk "Okay, you can do this, it’s just like training,"
    "You hear MK mumble to himself as he bends his knees a bit as he watches Monkey King’s every move."
    "It’s not long before Monkey King sprints towards him, but MK ignores the Monkey King and instead runs past him, his eyes on the staff. He makes sure to avoid the rest of the mob who are attempting to attack him to no avail. He keeps running as he holds his hand out once the staff is in close proximity. MK’s fingers wrap around the cold steel bar of the staff as he uses the staff to launch himself towards the windowsill."
    mk "Fyuree, now!"
    "You hold out your hand as MK grabs it before lifting you up onto the staff."
    mk "Hold on tight,"
    "MK warns you as he shoots the staff to head towards Flower Fruit Mountain, your next hiding place."
    "Though, while you two left the mob behind, you failed to notice that a certain monkey man had summoned a cloud and chased after you two."

############# SCENE THREE ###################

    "You land at the top of Flower Fruit Mountain, letting out a sigh of relief at being so far away from the city."
    mk "Alright, follow me."
    "MK starts to walk down the mountain, and you follow him. You hear a rustle nearby and turn, just to see a monkey hop out of a nearby bush and scamper away. For the first time you fully take in your surroundings, and your steps slow as you look around."
    "The forest around the path was practically bursting with plant life, and among that plant life were many vibrant flowers. It was so overwhelming, but so beautiful at the same time."
    mk "Come on, we need to get to the-"
    "MK stops when he notices how far behind you’ve gotten due to your slowed steps. He walks over to you."
    mk "Hey, we need to reach the waterfall."
    fp "This place is beautiful."
    "MK looks around at the forest, then back at you."
    mk "Well, I guess the waterfall can wait."
    "After a bit of exploring the forest, while not straying too far from the path, you and MK start walking towards the waterfall again."
    fp "I can’t believe we saw three more monkeys. There sure are a lot of them here, huh?"
    mk "Well, this is Flower Fruit Mountain."
    fp "What does that have to do with monkeys?"
    mk "Flower Fruit Mountain is Monkey King’s home, so of course all his monkey friends are gonna be here."
    fp "So, we’re hiding out from the Monkey King at his own home?"
    mk "Yeah! It’s so obvious that no one would see it coming."
    fp "Uh-huh. At least no one from the city should be able to get here, so that’s good."
    mk "Oh, there’s the waterfall!"
    "You stop and see MK pointing towards a giant waterfall. In front of it is a stream, with a bunch of rocks popping up at random spots. MK starts to hop across the rocks towards the waterfall, and gestures for you to follow him. You do, trying your best not to slip off the rocks."
    "As MK reaches the waterfall, he stretches out his hand to touch it. A golden symbol suddenly appears on top of the water, which splits apart. You can see a cavern through the split. MK crouches a bit, ready to jump through into the cavern, then pauses."
    mk "Do you want to go first?"
    fp "Yeah, thanks."

################ SCENE FOUR ###############

    "You smile at MK, then hop through into the cavern. MK steps to the other side of the waterfall as he follows you into Water Curtain Cave. The aqua blue rushing waters begin to calm, closing the entrance to the cave as the two of you begin to make your way through the cave that would lead you two to a safe place. Or so you hoped."
    "You look at your surroundings as you walk by, the sturdy feel of the bridge, the fresh air of the thriving green plants that surround you and the breathtaking view of the water gracefully flowing down to create a calm atmosphere."
    "This cave is indeed a sight to behold."
    "The greenery of the cave diminished as you neared the end of the bridge. Rocks and pillars filling the room as you notice light seeping in through a large hole in the wall. The hole clearly wasn’t cut, rather it seemed to have been broken on purpose. You walk up to the wall as you notice small, almost invisible paint on the wall."
    fp "Um, MK?"
    "He shakes his head lightly before placing his attention on the hole, a nervous look on his face."
    mk "Oh, that! Well, it’s a long story."
    "You were about to drop the conversation entirely… until he begins to give you a quick synopsis of what caused said hole."
    mk "I was training with Monkey King when I maybe, sorta… got tired of waiting to do the cool stuff. So, when I came across someone who was willing to give me what I wanted."
    "He stared at the hole, a small frown on his face."
    mk "Well,{w=0.3} I took it"
    "Silence filled the air as you didn’t dare to say a thing. MK soon takes a deep breath before the smile he seemed to always have graced his face once more. He looks over at a door as you turn around, your interest now peaked."
    mk "That’s Monkey King’s room of ancient treasures. I once brought one of my friends here because we had to save the city from a giant dumpling--"
    fp "Excuse me.{w} A giant what?!"
    mk "That's a story for another time! Anyways, let me just say, I sorta prefer having you here instead of him. He wasn’t the best when it came to getting places,"
    "You let out a small laugh as MK leads the way to the other side of the cave. The walk is peaceful and the previous awkward silence has now become comfortable. That is until you heard a familiar voice, a sense of dread washing over you."
    a "How ya doing there, peaches,"
    "There, standing between you and the exit, stood the Monkey King. His eyes half-lidded as he gave you a lovestruck smile. Not a second passes as you soon feel arms wrap around your right arm."
    "Monkey King brushed his face against your shoulder, closing his eyes as he enjoyed the feeling of your skin. Your first reaction is to look at MK with a pleading face."
    "{i}Please MK, help!{/i}"
    "You don’t have to say a word as MK rushes to your side and attempts to pry the monkey man off of you. Monkey King’s content soon turns into annoyance as he mumbles under his breath."

    ############# SCENE FIVE ##############

    "MK escorted you into the Monkey King’s house, the first thing you notice is a nice living room filled with comfortable furniture, a couch sat on one side of the room and in front of the couch was a long glass table. Across from that was a bamboo table that held an old 1990’s TV that rested on a video player."
    "Atop the TV was a video tape, curious, you walk to it to see what movie Sun Wukong could’ve been watching. The side facing up was blank, so you flipped it over and saw the title of the movie “The Count of Monte Cristo”. ‘A classic revenge story.’"
    "You put the video tape back on the TV and you look to the left , there was a small collection of VHS and DVDs."
    "“Wizard of Oz”, “Halloween”, “Bambi”, “Ex Machina”, “The Hunchback of Notre Dame”, “The Outsiders”, “Who Framed Roger Rabbit”, “Predator”, and “Beetlejuice”."
    "{i}‘He certainly has… interesting taste’{/i}"

    mk "He sure has quite a library of movies, doesn’t he?” MK asked."
    mk "From the looks of it, he doesn’t seem to have a specific genre he likes or sticks to, he has horror, mystery, action, and even musicals."

    mk "“I mean, when I met him, one of the first things he told me was to believe in myself.”"
    u "“What else did he say?”"
    mk "“Well, he said that I would be his successor and that I could handle anything. Also, he said something along the lines of him watching me.”"
    u "“Watching you?!”"
    mk "“Yea, wait…” MK sat there in a daze probably wondering how long the Monkey King might’ve been watching him. From the moment he took the staff or maybe when he started working at Pigsy’s noodles?"

label mk_scene_five:
    "MK puts his hand on the back of his head, tampering a little with his hair, wondering what he should say or do next that could keep you entertained until the Monkey King returns. Then an idea pops in his head."

    u "“Sure! Beats sitting and doing nothing.”"
    "You and MK get up from the couch. The brunette leads you around the house showing you the bedroom, bathroom, attic, creepy basement, dining room, and lastly the kitchen."

    "However the kitchen was coated in cobwebs that were seen from the corners of the microwave to the stove, it gave enough evidence that the kitchen hadn’t been used in months, maybe years."
    mk "“Wow, looks like Monkey King doesn’t prefer to eat cooked food I guess,” MK stated."
    u "“Then why would he have a kitchen?”"
    mk "“Perhaps to store food?”"
    u "“Well why bother hav-” The player is interrupted by MK."
    mk "“I’ll go find some cleaning supplies, maybe we can try to cook something in here. Be right back.” MK left to get a broom or some rags."

    "You walk around the kitchen to find some cooking utensils, however, as you were looking, you spot a basket of freshly picked peaches. Next to them were many, many bags of Peach Chips, your stomach growls in hunger, so you grab a the pink fruit from the basket."
    "However, as you’re about to take a bite, MK walks, he sees you about to take a bite and drops everything, running towards you."
    an "{size=+10}“No stop!!”{/size}"
    "In a panic, MK smacks the peach out of your hand."
    u "“Why’d you do that?! I was hungry!”"
    mk "MK pointed to the fruit, now on the floor. “Those aren’t peaches, take a single bite and you’ll turned into an immortal your whole life! You’ll be just like Wukong, unable to die no matter what!”"
    u "Suddenly your anger is turned into gratitude. “I… I didn’t know that, thank you.”"
    mk "“No problem.” MK looks at you and notices that you’ve been craving something to eat since you got to Flower Fruit Mountain."
    mk "“Hey, if you’re craving peaches, how about I go and get us some non-immortal peaches?”"
    u "“You do that?”"
    mk "“Yea, I’ll only be gone for a couple minutes, I’ll be back before you know it. Do you suppose we need anything other than peaches?”"
    u "“Definitely, I’ll make go and make a short list of things we need.” You look around and grab a small notepad and pen and start listing items off the top of your head. When you’re done you give the list to MK, he grabs his staff and heads off."
    "You noticed that on the floor is a broom, a bottle spray, some rags, a feather duster, and mop. You pick up the cleaning equipment."
    "{i}He must’ve dropped those when he came back.{/i}"
    "It be best to clean the kitchen while MK is gone, so you grab the supplies and got to work. As you swept and dust, you open the window to allow the fresh air to vent inside. After you finished sweeping and dusting the area, you picked up a bucket, filled it with water and soap."
    "Mopping the floors wasn’t easy, it was covered with some sticky or slimy residue that was hard to get off, eventually you had to use a rag to scrub it off."
    "When the kitchen looked cleaned, you made sure to check every corner and small areas just to make sure every spot was spotlessly cleaned. Afterall, there was fur found on the counter, most likely from the little monkeys that sat or maybe even played on them."
    "As you look around the kitchen proud of your hard work, you look in the fridge and pantry for some food or leftover ingredients you can use. With the small armful of ingredients laid out on the counter, you figured it could be used to make a simple peach cake."
    "You grab a couple bowls and round cake pans, and get to work."
    "MK walks through the door, bags of groceries hanging from his arms and hands. He gently kicked the door behind him close and you catch his attention.You already make your way to him before he can even ask for help. Grabbing the bags on his left arm, lifting most of the weight off him, you and MK walk to the kitchen and set them on the kitchen island."
    mk "As you’re both taking some of the items out of the bag, he notices the bowls and ingredients out.“What’re you making?”"
    u "“Peach cake!”"
    mk "“Yummy! Mind if I help?”"
    u "“Of course, I just started and there’s a lot to do.” You and MK get the rest of the ingredients ready, you grab the eggs, flour, sour cream, baking powder, and salt. MK gets the butter, sugar, vanilla, and non-immortal granting peaches."
    "However, as you and your partner are getting setup, a question lingers in your mind."
    u "“MK, why are there so many peaches on this island?”"
    "This hits MK with a perfect opportunity to give his very detailed response."
    mk "“Well ever since Monkey King ate some of the Peaches of Immortality from the Celestial Realm, he took the ones he didn’t eat, leaving the garden peach-less. He turns some of the peaches into peach chips, the ones you see in that corner over there. And the rest he plants them on this island, growing more immortal peaches."
    mk "“I assume he keeps them so that they stay out of the wrong hands, I mean if you ask me, having everlasting life sounds more like a curse and nightmare rather than a dream come true."
    mk "Everybody makes it seem that living forever sounds exciting, but if you think about it, everyone you meet that isn’t a demon or immortal is going to come and go in your life very quickly."
    mk "“Not to mention, Monkey King is a suitable guardian for the peaches, sure they were safer in the Celestial Realm, but Monkey King is just as good watching and protecting them."
    mk "“Oh sorry, I’ve been going on and on.”"
    u "“It’s ok, I actually didn’t know there was a whole backstory dedicated to the Peaches of Immortality. That’s amazing!”"
    mk "MK is flustered by your response. “Speaking of which, if you want, do you want me to tell you about Monkey King?”"

    "Sure!":
        mk "“Ok, so, Monkey King, believe it or not, was born from a rock that *pop* splits in half and out goes the monkey. He runs into some other monkeys nearby and they’re playing in the water, until one day they follow the source of their water to find a waterfall."
        mk "And one of the monkeys is all like, ‘hey if anyone is brave enough to jump through and find what’s on the other side, they can become the leader’. So Monkey King jumps through and finds this large bridge and so the monkeys declare him their king, so he takes the throne and calls himself the Handsome Monkey King."
        mk "When Monkey King goes through years of training and becomes immortal he decides to search for a weapon, so he goes to the ocean and takes this staff that weighs over 7,960 kg and Ao Guang, so amazed by his strength, summons his brothers to make him an outfit.”"
        "As MK tells you the story you can’t help but feel that there were some things in the narrative that were being twisted or changed to beseech the monkey as a greater demon than he already is."
        "He hands you the bowl of mixed flour, salt, and baking powder, and with a whisk, you mixed the powders together. And before you know it he’s talking about Monkey King and the Celestial Realm."
        mk "“So when he found out, that he was given the lowest rank ever in Heaven, he’s infuriated and runs away back to Flower Fruit Mountain and to make himself feel better he calls himself the ‘Great Sage Equal to Heaven’.” Something about that peculiar part made you giggle."
        "It was becoming clear to you that the Monkey King was somewhat of an impulsive guy, which makes sense because he is a monkey. However, if he wasn’t a monkey, would he still be as impulsive as he is?"
        mk "“It literally takes the entire force of Heaven to capture him, in fact, Nezha, Erlang Shen, the Four Heavenly Kings, Laozi, and Guanyin had to put everything they had. They bring him to Heaven where they put him in the crucible where after nearly 50 days, it’ll remove the immortality granting pills that he ate earlier."
        "But after 49 days, when they open the crucible, Monkey King comes out stronger than before and that’s how he got his fiery eyes or his gold vision, where he can now sense any evil presence."
        "So the Jade Emperor calls Buddha and he makes a bet to Monkey King and to sum it up, Monkey King ends up trapped under a mountain that’s sealed. And he doesn’t get out for the next 500 years until he meets Tang Sanzang. But that’s another long story for another day.”"

    "Once the batter was all used up, the pan was put inside the the oven. As you and MK wait, you clean up the mess in the kitchen, washing the dishes with MK helping by drying. Washing the bowls and the measuring cups and putting them away while also covering leftover ingredients in big Xiploc bags."

The smell of peaches brought attention to many infants who followed the scent with their parents worriedly following in pursuit. All of them had surrounded the kitchen, eyes stared at the oven, while ambitiously waiting for the cake to be done."
    "Luckily it didn’t take much longer for the cake finish and you take it out from the oven, placing it on the counter. You and MK notice the monkeys eyeballing the cake. However, the cake would need to cool before it could be eaten, so to avoid the monkeys from trying to grab a slice and burning their mouths, you place a glass dome over the cake."
    "The monkeys are forced to wait what felt like hours but was only 30 minutes, before you remove the glass dome and carefully cutting the cake. Not wanting to take your eyes off the cake, you ask MK to grab a few plates, which he kindly does."
    "You place a small piece on each plate and gently sliding it to MK to give to the monkeys. The monkeys shared slices with their families and friends, some only picking and eating the peaches while some were fighting over the same small piece not knowing there were more inside the cake."
    "You manage to save MK and yourself the last two pieces, you hand MK his piece and he takes a bite, his eyes filled with admiration. The cake that he helped bake turned out moredelicious than he’d ever thought, no wonder the monkeys were fighting for more. Some were even licking the plate clean."

    "Despite your frightening situation, you sense that you’ve been through this before with Wukong and remember that he was giving the same impression Wukong was doing earlier. Wukong was making strong advances towards you and had a hint of pink hidden in his eyes."
    "That and it took three rejections from you to make him cough up some weird pink smoke for Wukong to go back to normal."
    "You look carefully at Macaque’s eyes closely and saw the same shade of pink that Wukong had. An idea pops in your head."
    mac "“C’mon my dear plum, let’s get out of this run down shack. I know you love me, don’t you?”"
    u "“Love you?! I don’t even know you and if I wanted to date Wukong I would’ve gone out with him.” You expected Macaque to cough up the mysterious pink smoke, but nothing happened. He seemed to have been unaffected by your rejection as he continued walking towards your direction."
    "MK moved to attack, but Macaque sunk into his shadow, disappearing. You feel yourself being lifted from the ground and flung over someone’s shoulder."
    mac "“Nice seeing you kid.” Macaque said. He kept a firm grip on you before he flew out the house leaving a baffled MK behind."

Though, to your relief, MK was no longer behind Macaque and while you were happy that he was safe, you wanted to know just exactly where he went."

            "Macaque’s head whipped around at the source of the sound. His eyes went wide at the sight of the brunette before squinting down into an icy glare. He then had a gentle grip on your wrists, allowing him to pull your arms away from his shoulder and free him. Freedom to deal with MK any way he pleased. All you could do was stare, your mind running with different ideas and your body moved before you could even process your next words."

    mk "“Huh?”"
