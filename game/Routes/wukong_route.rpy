    "Though, it seems that you weren’t looking hard enough as the minute you stepped out of the alleyway you had hidden in, a small group set their eyes on you. They stare at you, eyes glazed and half-lidded. It was quite an uncomfortable sight. You were still as a stone, hoping that if you didn’t move, they wouldn’t come after you. That plan, of course, backfired immediately as the group started to make slow steps towards you."
    "Every step that you took back, they took two steps forward. Not a second passed before you began to sprint in the different direction, the group following soon after."
    "Left, right, another right, it didn’t matter to you what direction you went as long as they weren’t there. Your legs began to burn, each step made your legs feel like they would give in at any second and bring you down to your knees for the group to swallow you whole. You didn’t know how long you were running, but the thoughts running through your head came to a screeching halt as you felt a hand on your arm, pulling you into a dark corner."
    "You were about to scream, but all that came out was a muffled yelp as you felt a hand clasp over your mouth. A silent hush being all you could hear and out of the corner of your eyes, you watched the small group that was chasing after you ran past your current hiding place."
    "The hand that had once covered your mouth fell, letting you release a small breath you had been holding in. Though, your eyes soon drifted from the street to the stranger who had helped you out. You were about to say something, when the stranger placed a finger to their lips, indicating to be silent to which you listen and pressed your lips together, a bit scared of what might happen if even a peep left your mouth."
    "You instead opted to watch the stranger, who craned their neck to look to the right, then the left and repeat for a few seconds before taking a hold of your arm for the second time. You don’t hesitate to pull away from him, this man was a stranger after all. Sure, he might have helped you get away from the small mob but that didn’t mean he didn’t have any ulterior motives."
    fp "“Who are you? Are you one of them? What do you want from me?” The influx of questions made the stranger stop in their tracks. They paused before shaking their head, not exactly answering your questions, but it was at least something."
    a "“My sincerest apologies, I’m not gonna… I mean no harm. The name’s… Grimpil, Grimpil Sun.”"
    "Something about his sentence seemed… off to you. His tone was strained and slow like he was being careful with his words, afraid to mess up and say the wrong thing. It was as if he wasn’t used to talking in this way. You didn’t dare to question him on it."
    g "“Any reason those people were after you? From the looks of it, they weren’t exactly friendly.”"
    "You give him a small shake of your head. One minute you were on stage and celebrating with the town, the next, you’re running up and down the streets from a giant horde of people screaming your name, but not like the cheers you heard at the bake-off."
    "No."
    "These were obsessive screeches, people trampling over each other, hoping to get their hands on you."
    "It all made a shiver run down your spine."
    "The horrid memories soon slowed to a stop at the sound of a sigh. You turn to look at the person, Grimpil Sun, who scanned the street for the second time. A small smile appeared on his face before gesturing you to follow him as he stepped out of the small alleyway, letting you get a better look at him. The soft glow of the lights illuminating his face."
    "You do your own sweep of the street, not wanting to have yet another surprise mobbing. When you spot no one other than your savior, you walk out of the safety of the dark alley and take your place next to Grimpil Sun as the two of you walk. More so, you were doing your best to follow him, his steps seeming like strides."
    fp "“So, where are we going?”"
    "He doesn’t turn to look at you, his eyes set on the road ahead. He only gives you two words in response."
    g "“Somewhere safe.”"
    "The sudden shift in his tone makes you quirk a brow as he seems to notice your confusion, quick to return to his strange speech pattern."
    g "“A… place of refuge, if you will.”"

########## SCENE TWO #############

    "You follow Sun as the two of you sneak through the city. At least, you try to follow him. Even though it doesn’t look like he is running, Sun is moving very fast and you can barely keep up. You slowly start to fall behind, unable to match his speed."
    "Sun looks around, surveying the city, then turns to look back at you and notices that you’ve fallen far behind. He lets out a groan and stops, giving you time to catch up."
    fp "“Thanks.”"
    "Sun just gives a small nod before setting off again, still moving incredibly fast. This time you are determined to keep up, breaking out into a full sprint."
    "{i}How can he walk that fast?{/i}"
    "Sun keeps looking around, searching for something, but you were too focused on keeping up with him to wonder what he could be looking for. Your sprint slows into a speedwalk as you start to run out of energy. Even sprinting you had been falling behind, and now you could barely keep up. Sun didn’t seem to notice though."
    fp "“Sun!”"
    "Sun turns around and sees that you’ve fallen behind again, so he stops. You notice a slight scowl on his face, and you give him a small apologetic smile in return as you catch up. He lets out a little huff and continues walking, this time moving noticeably slower, to the point where you can keep up with him at a speedwalk."
    fp "“So, you’re a pretty fast walker. Do you do a lot of marathons?”"
    "Sun gives you a quick glance before going back to scanning the buildings around you two."
    g "“Not really. Well, there was one I guess, but it wasn’t exactly a marathon.”"
    fp "“Really? What was it?”"
    g "“It was more of a journey than a marathon.”"
    fp "“Where were you going?”"
    g "“Look, it’s a long story, and I need to focus right now, okay?”"
    fp "“Alright.”"
    "You walk for a bit more, Sun’s pace slowly getting faster and faster. Unfortunately, with his slowly increasing pace you find yourself slowly falling behind. Eventually Sun stops, a smile forming on his face as he spots the place he was looking for."
    "Sun turns around only to see that you’ve fallen very far behind by this point. He lets out an annoyed huff, then walks over to you."
    fp "“I’m sorry.”"
    g "“Well, luckily for you, we’re here.”"
    "Sun grabs your hand and leads you into Pigsy’s Noodle Shop."

############# SCENE THREE ##################

    "The shop was quiet as the two of you entered through the door, closing it behind you to keep the world out. The silence was soon broken by the sound of slurping, you both turned your heads to look at the origin of the sound to find a well-dressed figure, sitting at a counter."
    g "“Tang?”"
    "Tang stopped in his tracks, the sound of slurping food came to a halt as he turned around. You were able to get a better look of his face. You thought he seemed like a nice person. Though that faded when you noticed the intense stare that he was giving you. His eyes on you made a shiver run down your spine. You stepped closer to Grimpil Sun, hiding behind him and using him as a sort of human shield."
    "Grimpil Sun had quite the opposite reaction as he looked at Tang, then you and back to Tang again. This went on for a few seconds more before he let out a soft sigh and broke the uncomfortable air of silence in the room."
    g "“Tang, mind um, informing me about a certain someone. Maybe someone by the name of, I don’t know… Sun Wukong?”"
    "You give him a look of confusion, wondering what the point of mentioning the Monkey King was. Though you didn’t have any time to think about that as you heard Tang scoff and noticed that he had begun to stand up from his seat. His hands held a bowl, chopsticks in hand as he walked towards the two of you. Once he stands in front of you, he grabs a dumpling with his chopsticks and presses the dumpling to your lips."
    tang "“Go on, take a bite, my sweet dumpling.”"
    "Grimpil felt that something was off, he picked you up, throwing you over his shoulder and made his way out the front door. At first, his pace was normal, though the urgency in his steps was nothing short of present. It took you a second to process what had just happened but that moment was short at the sight of Tang, who had begun walking towards you and Grimpil."
    fp "“He’s following us,”"
    "At the sound of your words, Grimpil Sun picked up the pace of his walking, Tang did the same. This cycle continued until the two had begun full-on sprinting with you still over Grimpil Sun’s shoulder, watching these two men run away like they were playing a game of tag."

    "You catch up to Sun and smile. "
    "Sun huffs and turns away to continue on his search. "
    fp "“I never would’ve imagined this would happen after I’ve been gone for so long. I’ve had my share of eventful events, things can go hectic as a food critic when going to different restaurants, but not as crazy as a mob chasing after me.”"
    "Sun focuses on his task, not acknowledging with even a glance that he listens to them. "
    "You try again at small talk. This time, asking him what he could be looking for, but Sun still won’t say a word. Sun hurries to the next inspection of a building."
    "You can’t keep up, even as you run. Any attempt at more small talk is gone until Sun stops in place."
    "He turns around, smiling, seeing the familiar sign of Pigsy’s Noodle Shop. It fades when you weren’t close by like he expects. "
    "Sun walks up to the player."
    "You hear a low growl from him, and he grabs your hand to pull you behind him into the shop."

################ SCENE SEVEN ##############

    a "“Fyuree!”"
    "A loud voice erupted catching your attention, you and Grimpil Sun whip your heads to Tang who was standing anticipating a big bowl of your noodles. An obnoxious smile spread across his face, chopsticks in hand ready to eat. He almost looked like he was going to take Sun’s bowl. Grimpil had to give the man a hard glare to make sure he didn’t try to take any of his food. Luckily for him, he didn’t seem interested in his noodles, only in yours."
    "You serve the man his bowl of hot, steaming noodles with a side of an annoyed eye roll."
    "Loud eating noises came from Tang as he ate your food, for a second you were concerned he was going to choke, but he didn’t. It seemed like he was used to eating noodles this fast and not worrying about stopping. Something about the situation was almost funny, it was like watching a kid content with their meal after bugging their mom all day asking when dinner is ready."
    "Grimpil looks at you holding back a laugh behind a smug expression, seeing him bear his laughter made you smile. Neither of you wanted to be the first to laugh, it would be seen as rude to do so while someone is eating. Between the two of you, it was almost like a competition to see who would laugh first while maintaining eye contact, and whoever did, lose. You and Grimpil couldn’t hold your laugh anymore, at the same time you both lost the unspoken game and exploded into waves of laughter."
    "As Tang continued to slurp his noodles, he easily noticed you and Grimpil having a good time without him. Whatever was happening, he wanted in on it."
    "He let out a small cough, but you didn’t hear it."
    "A few more small coughs, still no response."
    "He releases a couple of very loud and exaggerated coughs, this time you and Grimpil heard him and stopped laughing."
    "Your attention is redirected to Tang."
    tang "“So, who do you like more me or… him.”"
    "He pointed his chopsticks at Grimpil, it seemed he was repulsed to not even mention Grimpil by his name. You look at Grimpil and he looked ticked that the two of you were interrupted for a simple question."
    fp "“Well, I would say Grimpil is a clear option since he’s already helped me a lot today.”"
    tang "“Hmph.”"
    "Tang looked back at his noodles and moved his chopsticks to the bowl, but he didn’t pick with his food. He didn’t look up at you or your friend, he was very focused on whatever he was doing noodles. The chopsticks stayed inside the bowl moving, it looked like he was playing ng. You watch him carefully move each noodle with precision and care, none of you had a clue what he could be doing so you let him continue in silence."
    "Grimpil looks at you in confusion, you look back at him and none of you say anything as if communicating telepathically."
    "You hear Tang put down his chopsticks and look at him again, rather than his face showing determination, it was replaced with pleased and contentment."
    tang "“Fyuree, come look at my picture.”"
    "You raise an eyebrow, confused about what he means by picture, you move closer to Tang and looked inside the bowl. Grimpil looks as well, the both of you see a mess of noodles, nothing unique."
    g "“What is it?” "
    "Grimpil asked more weirded out than confused."
    tang "“It’s you, Fyuree.”"
    "You look closer at the noodles and although it was upside down, you think you might see an outline of your face."
    tang "“What do you think?”"
    menu:

        "Be nice":
            fp "“It’s beautiful, I can tell you’re a talented artist. I don’t know how you did this in a short amount of time, but it’s lovely.”"
            "Tang’s face blushes red listening to your compliments. You feel horrible having to lie to him but you didn't want to hurt his feelings, so it was best to not make him feel bad."
            "Grimpil watches you lie through your teeth while he continues to eat his noodles."
            g "“Hey,”"
            "You turn to Grimpil."
            g "“Were you saying all that stuff to be nice?”"
            fp "“Maybe…”"
            "He raises an eyebrow at you."
            fp "“Ok, yes. I didn’t want to hurt his feelings, that’s all. And he looked so proud of his work and-.”"
            tang "“Thanks for the noodles! They’re almost as good as Pigsy’s, but don’t tell him that.”"
            "Tang reaches to you for a hug, you try to take a step back but he was quicker and trapped you in a hug. You didn’t hug him back since he didn’t ask."
            "Grimpil noticed you not returning the hug and can tell you weren’t alright with it. He stands up from his seat."
            g "“Listen here, bud. It's obvious they don't like you, so why don't you back off?”"
            "Tang looks at Grimpil almost surprised at how fast his tone changes from relaxed to stern. "
            "Tang focuses on you and before he can ask if you’d agreed with Grimpil, you nod. He lets you go albeit a little upset."

        "Be honest":
            "You squint at the noodles and what was supposed to be your face, but no matter how hard you looked at it, the only thing you could make out was the outline of your face. Reluctantly, you chose to be honest and gave him your real answer."
            fp "“Well, I don’t think art is your strong suit.”"
            "Tang was struck hard by your words, failure overcame his face, and you could he was about to cry but held back his tears."
            "Grimpil peered over Tang’s shoulder and looked at the mess of noodles in his bowl. His shoulders shook and he looked away from the bowl and Tang, his lips forced shut, as he used his strength to restrain his laughter. Unfortunately for him, he couldn’t keep it in any longer and burst out laughing which made you and Tang feel worse."
            g "“I think you should stick to writing, I agree with Fyuree, being an artist wouldn’t benefit you.”"
            "Grimpil laughed more until he was interrupted by an uncontrollable coughing fit coming from Tang."

label tang_rejected:
    "Tang is crouched and has to lean on the counter for support. You and Grimpil look at Tang worried he might have choked on the noodles when you both notice a pink cloud of smoke coming from his mouth. Your concern increased as you watch Tang continue to wheeze and pant while more pink smoke escapes from his mouth. You and Grimpil had the same idea to slowly back away from Tang not knowing what to expect. "
    "Grimpil looked like he was ready for a fight, worried that the pink smoke might transform into a living person. When the coughing stopped, you feel your shoulders relax and let out a breath you didn’t know you were holding. Grimpil also seemed to be relieved when Tang’s coughing ended."
    "When he looked up and noticed Grimpil, he nearly panicked."
    tang "“Sun Wu-!”"
    "Before he could finish, he was tackled by Grimpil who covered his mouth to keep him from finishing his words or saying anything else."
    "A confused expression was spelled across your face trying to figure out what was going on."
    "Grimpil noticed your confusion and lets out a nervous laugh, meanwhile, Tang is struggling under his grasp. He was trying to say something but Grimpil’s hand blocked the words from escaping his mouth. Grimpil’s smile assures you that everything is a joke and acted out, so you relax and don’t think."
    "When Tang has calmed down and Grimpil no longer needed to hold down Tang, they both sat up. Tang looked around the room, a little confused about how he got inside Pigsy’s Noodles and when. You and Grimpil let him get used to his setting before you spoke up."
    fp "“Tang, do you remember what just happened?”"
    tang "“No…? Why did I do something weird?”"
    fp "“No, you were acting clingy and… lovestruck.”"
    tang "“What?! Me? Nah there’s no way I would act like that.”"
    fp "“But you were moving the noodles in your bowl to make a picture and-”"
    tang "“As if I would do such a thing.”"
    "It didn’t seem like Tang wanted to believe anything you were telling him, he was truly convinced he wasn’t acting lovestruck."
    "Grimpil stands close to you and speaks in a low voice."
    g "“Tang doesn’t remember anything that just transpired and he doesn’t believe he was acting like a lovestruck puppy. My guess is that he’s under a spell.”"
    fp "“Like, a love spell?”"
    g "“Most likely.”"
    "Suddenly, you and Grimpil hear a crowd of people outside, it seemed they were quickly approaching your direction. Everyone turns to the door and windows, they haven’t arrived yet, but they’re close."
    g "“We need to get out of here, everyone is going to find us and break down the door to get in here!”"
    fp "“One thing for sure, we need to leave and find somewhere else to hide.”"
    g "“Agreed.”"
    tang "“B-But where will we hide?”"
    "Tang almost looked worried but trusts that you had a plan in mind."
    fp "“We need to get out through the back door, but it’s locked so the only way out is through the front.”"
    tang "“So we’ll have to charge our way past the crowd?”"
    g "“Pretty much.”"
    fp "“Once we find somewhere else to hide, we need to figure out what happened to the town, how to reverse the effect, and if someone is behind it, interrogate them.”"
    tang "“You think someone managed to curse the whole town?”"
    fp "“I’m not too sure, but-”"
    "Bang! Bang! Bang!"
    "The door shakes from the citizens outside knocking and hitting the door until it flies open by the force of the city folk. Grimpil is quick to grab the door and jump kick the door back into the doorway, he runs and holds it in place. The citizens struggle behind the door, desperately trying to get in, while Grimpil almost effortlessly holds the door back. Grimpil keeps the door from flying again while Tang panics."
    "Tang runs around the room hoping to find the key to the backdoor, while you notice Grimpil is noticeably proud of himself for who knows what."
    fp "“Tang, calm down, you’ll be able to find it if we all have a clear head.”"
    "He snaps out of his head and looks at you."
    tang "“You’re right.”"
    "You and Tang look for places where a key might be hidden and luckily for you and Grimpil, it doesn’t take long for Tang to find the key."
    tang"“Guys! I found it! The key was in my pocket the whole time!”"
    "You can hear Grimpil’s neck crack as he glares at Tang, and you start to laugh until Grimpil glares at you too."
    g "“Alright, since we found the key, let’s hurry up and get out of here!”"

# SMALL TALK (IN PROGRESS)

######## SCENE NINE #######

    "After checking the crosswalk, you all cross the street. You and Tang reach the other side, but Sun stops right before the sidewalk."
    fp " Why’d you stop? Is something wrong?"
    g "Do you hear that?"
    "You pause and realize you can hear the sound of a motor, getting louder and louder. Suddenly, a vehicle rounds a nearby corner and barrels straight towards you. You stare in suprise as it runs right over Sun before screeching to a stop. "
    "You look over at Sun, who sits up and glares at the driver, but his expression quickly turns to shock. You turn and realize that MK was the person driving the cart."
    "{i}Why would MK run someone over?{/i}"
    "You discard that thought quickly though and rush over to Sun to see if he is okay. When you arrive next to him though, you notice that there doesn’t seem to be any visible injuries."
    fp "How are you not dead?"
    g "Uh, I work out…or something."
    "You raise an eyebrow at that, but decide not to push it. Sun stands up and walks over to the cart, and you follow. You see MK glaring daggers at Sun and wonder why he is so mad."
    g "Uh, hey bud. Is something wrong?"
    mk "Get away from my treasure!"
    "MK points at you. Did he just call you his treasure?"
    g "Your treasure? Do you mean the staff? But I don’t even have that."
    "Did Sun not see MK point at you? Or was he just not paying attention? Well, being run over could definitely damage your thought process. You could feel anger rising at MK for running Sun over, and you step forward between Sun and MK."
    fp "You shouldn’t run people over! It’s rude and could really hurt them."
    "MK completely ignores what you’re saying and immediately wraps you in a hug. What was going on? You look up at Sun and mouth ‘help me’. He nods and walks up to MK."
    g "Hey bud, I think that’s enough hugs for now, okay?"
    mk "Leave me alone, you pathetic excuse of a mentor."
    "Sun steps back, his eyes widening. You look down at MK in shock. MK was being mentored by Sun? And how could he say something like that? You hear Tang slurping noodles behind you, and wonder where he got noodles, but immediately push that thought out of your head."
    menu:
        "Defend Sun":
            fp "How could you say that? I mean, I may not know much about your mentor-mentee relationship, but from what I’ve seen, Sun is a good person. He helped me escape the angry mob, even though he got kind of annoyed that I ran so slow. And he tried to get me away from Tang when he was acting weird. Although he did just hoist me over his head without saying anything. But, um, he also, umm…"
            "You trail off as you notice that Sun is trying not to laugh."
            fp "Hey, I’m trying my best, okay?"
            "Sun gives you an appreciative smile. You return the smile, then feel a tug on your arm. You look down and see that MK has grabbed your arm."

        "Stay quiet":
            "Unsure of what to say, you simply reach out and put your hand on Sun’s arm. He gives you a small smile, but it fades quickly and he looks away."
            "MK looks up at you, then your hand. He reaches out and snatches your hand and pulls it off Sun’s arm. You try to yank your hand away, but MK has a surprisingly strong grip on it, and you can’t shake him off."

    "MK pauses and thinks for a bit, then a big smile lights up his face."
