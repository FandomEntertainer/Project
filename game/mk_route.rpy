    "So, it seems that the Monkey King wouldn’t be any help to you two now. MK sees that and begins to ponder up a solution. Though his thinking is interrupted by the sound of rapid footsteps and overlapping yells. And there near the door, you could see a mob coming up the stairs and attempting to step in through the doorway at the same exact time. "
    fp "MK, we need a plan, fast!"
    "You yell, worried that the mob may barge in at any second. MK scans the room, trying to find an escape route, but his plans shift when his eyes land on the staff that laid on the counter, on the other side of the room. There were only a few problems with this plan he had come up with."
    "One, he would have to leave you alone for a while as he runs to the other side of the room to grab the staff, two, he could possibly get attacked by the love zombies, three, the love zombies would have a chance to get to you and take you away. All these consequences stirred inside his brain, he was starting to rethink his options, but he looked at you."
    "He saw the fear in your eyes as you watched the door with the utmost focus and that's when he made up his mind."
    mk "Do you trust me?"
    "MK holds out his hand as you stare at his hand for a moment before giving him a smile and placing your hand in his."
    fp "Yes,"
    "You see his smile grow as he gives your hand a gentle squeeze before leading you to a window sill where he opens the window. He gestures to you to head out through it, to which you do. He doesn’t let go of your hand as he makes sure that you make it safe on the fire escape balcony."
    mk "Stay here, wait for my signal and hold your hand out, okay?"
    "You nod as MK smiles."
    mk "Good,"
    "You feel the warmth of his hand fade as he slowly lets go to go back to the mob and Monkey King, who was giving MK a death glare."
    "MK takes a deep breath, you watch him, trying to stay hidden but also wanting to see what the young man would do."
    mk "Okay, you can do this, it’s just like training,"
    "You hear MK mumble to himself as he bends his knees a bit as he watches Monkey King’s every move."
    "It’s not long before Monkey King sprints towards him, but MK ignores the Monkey King and instead runs past him, his eyes on the staff. He makes sure to avoid the rest of the mob who are attempting to attack him to no avail. He keeps running as he holds his hand out once the staff is in close proximity. MK’s fingers wrap around the cold steel bar of the staff as he uses the staff to launch himself towards the windowsill."
    mk "Fyuree, now!"
    "You hold out your hand as MK grabs it before lifting you up onto the staff."
    mk "Hold on tight,"
    "MK warns you as he shoots the staff to head towards Flower Fruit Mountain, your next hiding place."
    "Though, while you two left the mob behind, you failed to notice that a certain monkey man had summoned a cloud and chased after you two."
    "You land at the top of Flower Fruit Mountain, letting out a sigh of relief at being so far away from the city."
    mk "Alright, follow me."
    "MK starts to walk down the mountain, and you follow him. You hear a rustle nearby and turn, just to see a monkey hop out of a nearby bush and scamper away. For the first time you fully take in your surroundings, and your steps slow as you look around."
    "The forest around the path was practically bursting with plant life, and among that plant life were many vibrant flowers. It was so overwhelming, but so beautiful at the same time."
    mk "Come on, we need to get to the-"
    "MK stops when he notices how far behind you’ve gotten due to your slowed steps. He walks over to you."
    mk "Hey, we need to reach the waterfall."
    fp "This place is beautiful."
    "MK looks around at the forest, then back at you."
    mk "Well, I guess the waterfall can wait."
    "After a bit of exploring the forest, while not straying too far from the path, you and MK start walking towards the waterfall again."
    fp "I can’t believe we saw three more monkeys. There sure are a lot of them here, huh?"
    mk "Well, this is Flower Fruit Mountain."
    fp "What does that have to do with monkeys?"
    mk "Flower Fruit Mountain is Monkey King’s home, so of course all his monkey friends are gonna be here."
    fp "So, we’re hiding out from the Monkey King at his own home?"
    mk "Yeah! It’s so obvious that no one would see it coming."
    fp "Uh-huh. At least no one from the city should be able to get here, so that’s good."
    mk "Oh, there’s the waterfall!"
    "You stop and see MK pointing towards a giant waterfall. In front of it is a stream, with a bunch of rocks popping up at random spots. MK starts to hop across the rocks towards the waterfall, and gestures for you to follow him. You do, trying your best not to slip off the rocks."
    "As MK reaches the waterfall, he stretches out his hand to touch it. A golden symbol suddenly appears on top of the water, which splits apart. You can see a cavern through the split. MK crouches a bit, ready to jump through into the cavern, then pauses."
    mk "Do you want to go first?"
    fp "Yeah, thanks."
    "You smile at MK, then hop through into the cavern.MK steps to the other side of the waterfall as he follows you into Water Curtain Cave. The aqua blue rushing waters begin to calm, closing the entrance to the cave as the two of you begin to make your way through the cave that would lead you two to a safe place. Or so you hoped."
    "You look at your surroundings as you walk by, the sturdy feel of the bridge, the fresh air of the thriving green plants that surround you and the breathtaking view of the water gracefully flowing down to create a calm atmosphere."
    "This cave is indeed a sight to behold."
    "The greenery of the cave diminished as you neared the end of the bridge. Rocks and pillars filling the room as you notice light seeping in through a large hole in the wall. The hole clearly wasn’t cut, rather it seemed to have been broken on purpose. You walk up to the wall as you notice small, almost invisible paint on the wall."
    fp "Um, MK?"
    "He shakes his head lightly before placing his attention on the hole, a nervous look on his face."
    mk "Oh, that! Well, it’s a long story."
    "You were about to drop the conversation entirely… until he begins to give you a quick synopsis of what caused said hole."
    mk "I was training with Monkey King when I maybe, sorta… got tired of waiting to do the cool stuff. So, when I came across someone who was willing to give me what I wanted."
    "He stared at the hole, a small frown on his face."
    mk "Well,{w=0.3} I took it"
    "Silence filled the air as you didn’t dare to say a thing. MK soon takes a deep breath before the smile he seemed to always have graced his face once more. He looks over at a door as you turn around, your interest now peaked."
    mk "That’s Monkey King’s room of ancient treasures. I once brought one of my friends here because we had to save the city from a giant dumpling--"
    fp "Excuse me.{w} A giant what?!"
    mk "That's a story for another time! Anyways, let me just say, I sorta prefer having you here instead of him. He wasn’t the best when it came to getting places,"
    "You let out a small laugh as MK leads the way to the other side of the cave. The walk is peaceful and the previous awkward silence has now become comfortable. That is until you heard a familiar voice, a sense of dread washing over you."
    a "How ya doing there, peaches,"
    "There, standing between you and the exit, stood the Monkey King. His eyes half-lidded as he gave you a lovestruck smile. Not a second passes as you soon feel arms wrap around your right arm."
    "Monkey King brushed his face against your shoulder, closing his eyes as he enjoyed the feeling of your skin. Your first reaction is to look at MK with a pleading face."
    "{i}Please MK, help!{/i}"

    monk "Please believe me when I say that I would never think of calling you a troublesome brat or anything else of the sort."
    "MK’s eyes are wide open as he tries to process what Monkey King had just said."
    "Once he gets a clear head, MK smiles."
    mk "No worries, I forgive you!"
    "The Monkey King lets out a sigh, relieved that MK was alright, even after the harsh comment."
    "While MK forgives the Monkey King, you on the other hand didn’t forgive him so easily. Yes, you would let him off the hook this time, but you were going to keep an eye on Monkey King to make sure that he didn’t pull anything similar in the future."
    "You watch the heartwarming scene unfold for just a bit longer, until you notice Wukong’s curious eyes look at you."
    monk "Hey, kid. Who's the stranger?"
    "Monkey King points a thumb at you as MK’s mouth makes an o."
    mk "Monkey King,"
    "MK strolls up to your side,"
    mk "Meet my new friend, Fyu--"

    "MK’s jaw is wide open as he begins to contemplate his entire existence at the new revelation. While Monkey King is the complete opposite, he gives you a smile before introducing himself."
    monk "Monkey King,"
    "Is all he says, a proud smirk tugging on his lips."
    monk "Also, sorry for the situation back there. I… wasn’t myself. It was like I was under a spell or something,"
    "You let out a small sigh before giving him a smile,"
    u "It’s alright, like you said, you weren't yourself,"
    monk "Thanks for understanding, kid. It real--"
### Really wasn't my intention to drag you into this
    "Monkey King responds but is cut short by MK’s shouts."
    mk "Monkey King, you’ve gotta help us! The city’s all been turned into… into love zombies!"
    "Monkey King raises a brow at MK’s name for the cityfolk, confused by what his successor meant by 'love zombies.''"
    u "He means that the city is also under the spell,"
    "Monkey King’s eyes widen a bit at the news, but his shock is temporary. He balls his fist a bit, a small frown on his face as he starts to make his way toward the cave's entrance."
    monk "I’m going to scan the city,"
    "The Monkey King does a few arm stretches, he bends his knees a bit. His eyes on the sky as he gets ready to jump."
    mk "I’ll come with yo--"
    monk "No,"
    "Monkey King holds a hand out, stopping the boy from taking another step towards him."
    monk "I need you to stay here to guard your new friend. It’s not safe for them to be alone right now, you understand?"
    "MK lets out a small groan as he shoves his hands in his pockets and kicks the small rocks that are scattered around the ground with his feet."
    mk "Fine, I understand,"
    "Monkey King smiles before using his 72 transformations to transform into a bird."
    "MK watches Monkey King fly off, a soft sigh leaves his lips, but his frown disappears once he feels a hand on his shoulder. He turns his head to look at you. He smiles as he notices your gentle smile."
    mk "Wanna head inside?"
    "He points to the house that sits on a small hill up ahead. You nod as he grabs your hand and leads you to the house."
