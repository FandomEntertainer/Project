    "The ecstatic screams and professions of love from the crowd startled you. This was indeed not something that was a daily occurrence for you."
    "Your body began to move on its own when you noticed a swarm of city folk heading in your direction."
    "You ran as fast as your legs could take you, not caring about who or what you bumped into as the thought of the stampede behind you catching up was frightening to say the least."
    "In your rush to get away from the mob, you hear the sound of a young man yelling as you turn your head to the sound of his screams."
    "Some bright yellow lights shine upon your face, blinding you a tad bit."
    a "LOOK OUT!"
    "Your eyes widen and you cower as you see a cart barreling towards you."
    "The driver is more than quick to step on the brakes as the cart lifts up off the ground for a minute before slamming back down with a loud thud."
    "The sound of panicked footsteps could be heard, followed by a voice."
    a "Are you okay?!"
    "You slowly open your eyes as you are met with a familiar face."
    fp "M-MK?!"
    "A sheepish smile graces his face as he lets out a nervous laugh."
    mk "Yeah, that's me."
    "His voice waivers a bit as he doesn't seem to be thrilled by the fact you remembered him."
    mk "I’m so, so sorry about almost running you over!"
    "He cries out as he apologizes profusely."
    fp "It’s alright, MK. No one got hurt."
    "You tell him, but something about him is off. Unlike the rest of the city, he’s one of the only people who seems to be acting normal."
    "Maybe you can put your trust in him."
    fp "Hey, do you think we can go back to the shop? I’m… not sure it's safe to be out right now,"
    "MK gives you a confused look."
    mk "Why isn't it safe out here? Nothing weird seems to be going on."
    "He says as he looks around to find out what may be concerning you."
    fp "Well, the city might, might… be chasing after me."
    "You explain the situation to him, but he doesn't seem to be buying it."
    mk "Okay."
    "He elongates the word, clearly not believing anything that's coming out of your mouth right now."
    "The sound of yells catches your attention as both you and MK turn to see the mob that had returned, all the people shoving the others out of the way to make their way towards you."
    "But one person stands out from among the crowd. They shove their way from the middle of the crowd and become the center of attention."
    mk "Pigsy?!"
    "MK’s confusion fades into shock as he stares at the mob that is closing in on you two."
    fp "Now do you believe me?"
    "You yell at him, though he still doesn't seem to be fully convinced."
    mk"Well, I mean it's just Pigsy. What's so weird about him?"
    "My sweet!"
    "Pigsy yells out as he starts to run up towards you two."
    "Not a second passes as you quickly hop into the cart, but MK doesn't seem to be doing anything other than staring at the man that is running towards him."
    "This leaves you no other choice than to forcefully drag MK into the driver’s seat."
    fp "Drive.{w=0.3} Now!"
    "You tell him as MK nods before stepping on the accelerator and driving off as fast as the cart could take you two. You don't look back as MK begins to drive to the shop."
    "The car ride is silent as the only thing on both of your minds is to find a place to hide."
    "Once MK reaches the shop, you both jump out of the cart and rush inside the building, making sure you lock the door before taking a breather."
    mk "Okay… I believe you,"
    "MK says through heavy pants."
    fp "We can't stay here forever, can we?"
    "MK ponders for a minute."
    mk "Oh, we can hide in my room! It's not exactly the best hiding spot, but it'll give us more time to think of a plan!"
    "You agree as he leads you up to his room."

######## SCENE 2 ########

    "You both climb up the stairs that lead to his room as he slams the door open, arms outstretched as he steps inside."
    mk "Welcome, to my room!"
    "He exclaims with a smile on his face."
    mk "We can stay here for the meantime! Let’s block the door to prevent anyone from coming in."
    "This receives a small nod from you as the two of you begin to block the doorway with anything and everything you can find."
    "You soon look at the door that is now blocked, drawers, books and almost the whole room is blocking the door except for the chair, bed and immovable items."
    fp "I don’t think this’ll hold them back for very long."
    "You tell MK, who nods before an idea comes to his mind. You’re too busy thinking of more ways to block the door that you don’t hear MK’s warning to look out as you feel something smack against the back of your head."
    "Your vision goes dark and you feel yourself fall to the floor."
    "Your eyes flutter open as you are met with MK, no more than a few inches away from your face."

        "Push him":
            "You push MK away from you as he rolls back a bit on the swivel chair he is sitting on."
            mk "Sorry, I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable!"
            "He says as he looks at you."
            mk "Anyways, are you alright? You got bonked on the head pretty hard."
            "You nod your head as he smiles."

        "Stare at him":
            "You look at him. Neither of you say a word as the two of you have a small staring contest."
            mk "So…"
            "MK finally says."
            mk "Do you remember me? Do you remember anything that happened before you, uh… knocked out?"
            "You nod at his questions as he lets out a sigh of relief."
            mk "That’s good,"
            "He doesn’t move away, but the awkward tension was something to say the least."

    mk "Any idea how the city got all, you know…"
    "MK brings his finger up to the sides of his temple and spins it around while making a silly face."
    "You let out a small laugh at his silly antics before shaking your head."
    fp "Unfortunately, I don’t. It all just happened so quickly,"
    "The two of you begin to ponder why the city folk had gone crazy for, seemingly, no reason at all. You both stay silent, until MK’s eyes light up."
    "He grabs the chair that was in his room as he stands on it, one foot on the head rest and yells,"
    mk "It's Smartie Kid Time!"
    fp "What's a Smarite Kid, isn't that the American candy or something?"
    "MK gives the player a blank stare before saying,"
    mk "Well... I am sweet as candy, but that's besides the point. I’m trying to figure out what's going on. The city's acting really weird,like-"
    "MK gasps dramatically."
    mk "Demon magic weird!"
    "Demon…magic…?"
    "You question the brunette."
    mk "Yep, that kinda stuff happens all the time around here!"
    "MK shrugs."
    fp "So… how is it normally dealt with?"
    "You ask him. MK smiles at you."
    mk "The Monkie Kid usually takes care of it with his friends."
    fp "Well if he takes care of all the demon business then where is he?"
    "Mk grabs his staff and stands up proudly."
    mk "He’s standing right in front of you!"
    "…he’s so bright…it burns. You think to yourself."
    fp "Okay great! So how do we stop this?"
    "You ask excitedly."
    mk "We find out what the demon’s planning, then we thwart their plans and bonk them in the head!"
    "MK announces proudly."
    fp "Alright!"
    "You begin to get excited. Hope bubbling in your chest. Thank the god’s you won't have to deal with the mess that is a mob chasing you all throughout the city for much longer."
    fp "So what demon is causing this?"
    mk "o-OH uhm…"
    "MK pauses."
    fp "What are they planning?"
    "You ask again."
    mk "That-uhhhhh"
    "MK stumbles over his words."
    fp "You…have no idea do you?"
    mk "Nope! But we’ll find out!"
    "MK goes back to his positive state and puts his hands on his temple’s while scrunching up his face."
    fp "What are you doing?"
    mk "SMARTIE KID!"
    "A lightbulb appears over MK’s head and dings as it turns on."
    mk "I got it! The demon’s have made a mind control virus that gets into people’s heads and feeds off of their life force and turns them into zombies!"

        "Entertain":
            fp "While your positivity is nice MK, I think we should be a little more serious about this right now."

            mk "You're right! It's turning them into LOVE ZOMBIES!!!"

    fp "Okay back on topic, how are we supposed to find out what’s going on?"
    "MK tilts his head."
    mk "Hmm, I don't know."
    "MK looks around in thought for a moment then begins to quietly mumble to himself."
    mk "What would Monkey King do?"
    fp "You’re a big fan of the guy aren't you?"
    "You ask while glancing at all the merch he has hung up around his room."
    mk "Oh yeah! I've practically got the whole Journey to the West memorized and I-"
    "The door bursts open as the items that blocked the door fly around the room and there at the entrance of the room stood a man that MK knew all too well."
    mk "M-Monkey King?"
    "At the sound of his title, the Monkey King turns his head to look at the two of you. You mutter under your breath."
    fp "Speak of the devil,"
    "MK shakes his head as a smile graces his face."
    mk "Monkey King! I’m so glad you’re here! We need your help the city’s acting super wei–"
    monk "Peaches!"
    "Monkey King exclaims as he places a hand on the young man’s face and pushes him away before standing next to you. You take a step back, hoping to get some distance between you and the Monkey King."
    fp "Yeah, I think that whatever’s happening to the city is happening to the Monkey King, too."
    "So, it seems that the Monkey King wouldn’t be any help to you two now. MK sees that and begins to ponder up a solution. Though his thinking is interrupted by the sound of rapid footsteps and overlapping yells. And there near the door, you could see a mob coming up the stairs and attempting to step in through the doorway at the same exact time. "
    fp "MK, we need a plan, fast!"
    "You yell, worried that the mob may barge in at any second. MK scans the room, trying to find an escape route, but his plans shift when his eyes land on the staff that laid on the counter, on the other side of the room. There were only a few problems with this plan he had come up with."
    "One, he would have to leave you alone for a while as he runs to the other side of the room to grab the staff, two, he could possibly get attacked by the love zombies, three, the love zombies would have a chance to get to you and take you away. All these consequences stirred inside his brain, he was starting to rethink his options, but he looked at you."
    "He saw the fear in your eyes as you watched the door with the utmost focus and that's when he made up his mind."
    mk "Do you trust me?"
    "MK holds out his hand as you stare at his hand for a moment before giving him a smile and placing your hand in his."
    "Yes,"
    "You see his smile grow as he gives your hand a gentle squeeze before leading you to a window sill where he opens the window. He gestures to you to head out through it, to which you do. He doesn’t let go of your hand as he makes sure that you make it safe on the fire escape balcony."
    mk "Stay here, wait for my signal and hold your hand out, okay?"
    "You nod as MK smiles."
    mk "Good,"
    "You feel the warmth of his hand fade as he slowly lets go to go back to the mob and Monkey King, who was giving MK a death glare."
    "MK takes a deep breath, you watch him, trying to stay hidden but also wanting to see what the young man would do."
    mk "Okay, you can do this, it’s just like training,"
    "You hear MK mumble to himself as he bends his knees a bit as he watches Monkey King’s every move."
    "It’s not long before Monkey King sprints towards him, but MK ignores the Monkey King and instead runs past him, his eyes on the staff. He makes sure to avoid the rest of the mob who are attempting to attack him to no avail. He keeps running as he holds his hand out once the staff is in close proximity. MK’s fingers wrap around the cold steel bar of the staff as he uses the staff to launch himself towards the windowsill."
